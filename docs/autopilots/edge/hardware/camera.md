    Camera should only be turned on after Edge is [booted](../../led-status/)

In case you want to record video to an SD card while streaming, then start recording on the camera first and only after that start streaming using QGroundControl.


Video streaming was successfully tested on the following camera models (other models may work as well):

- GoPro HERO 3+
- GoPro HERO 4
- GoPro Hero 5
- YI Action Camera 1
- Sony Î±6000
